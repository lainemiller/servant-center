          You may look at and obtain a copy of your Protected Health Information

          in electronic format.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>To request that we correct your Protected Health Information.</b>
          If you think that there is a mistake or a gap in our file of your

          may deny your request if we find that the file is correct and
          complete, not created by us, or not allowed to be disclosed. If we
          deny your request, we will explain our reasons for the denial and your
          rights to have the request and denial and your written response added
          to your file. If we approve your request, we will change the file,

          that we must agree to a request not to send Protected Health
          Information to a health plan for purposes of payment or health care
          operations if you have paid in full for the related product or
          service. If we agree to all or part of your request, we will put our
          agreement in writing and obey it except in emergency situations. We
